- Show me your past projects   
   A great deal of my clients were/are security contracts with intense NDAs in place. However, if you look at my profile, you will see one responsive app called 'critical view'. One website I *can* show you is http://intellicarenetwork.com/ - we (myself and my team) also developed their flagship software, NCIS (http://intellicarenetwork.com/navi-call-2/), which is the only nurse-call software to ever gain UL certification in HISTORY. Experience is not an issue here.

- Review
Joseph delivered good work on this PHP development project and I enjoyed working with him. His communication was top-notch, he met all deadlines, and his skills were reasonably strong. At one point I asked for an additional milestone and he was very forthcoming that the additional work was outside his area of expertise. He helped me find additional freelancers to support the work. I enjoyed working with Joseph and will likely have additional jobs for him in the future.
